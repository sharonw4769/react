# Entry 6: Building the Application
### React Native vs React.JS
React Native uses JavaScript to build the actual mobile app whereas, React.JS is used to build web applications.
### *Learn ASL* App
The goal of this app is to teach sign language -- a complex language that is expressed by facial expressions and hand movements used to communicate. Because sign language is not often used, I believe this app will be a great start to teaching people the basics of sign language.
### Sample App
After taking a look at the [Poke Chewbacca app](https://repl.it/H0Qp/2) created by Alek Hurst, I recognized certain functions like `state` and `props` as well as event handlers like `onPress`. 

Here is a preview of the app:

And here is the code:

I played around with the code and soon after, I got the idea of what to do with my app. 

### Building My Own App
I started off with 'Hello World!' to make sure that I can preview it on my phone.

After several hours of tinkering and looking for certain parts of the code like how to align text and add an image, my app came out to look like this:

### Takeaways
* Remember, explore around and LOYO - Learn On Your Own! Do what it takes to help you better understand the material. Personally, I like to test things out and try to understand certain portions of the code and its purpose. 
* Taking a look at the code of an existing application is very helpful, especially when you notice certain parts of the code. This will help you understand even better because once you get the idea of what the app does, you can process the code and even apply it to your own app. 
* Take your time with your app. Greats things take a lot of time. Just persevere and just keep coding!
