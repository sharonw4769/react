# Entry 7: Building the App (Cont'd)
### Plans
This week, I will be taking my own pictures for my app. I will be using http://www.lifeprint.com/ as my resource. This way, I can learn some sign language myself while teaching others! 

Currently, I have created two pages, one for **LESSON 1: Numbers** and one for **LESSON 2: ABCs**.

I also created the home page which will consist of the goal of this app and instructions on how to use the app.

### My Next Steps 

### Takeaways
* Building this app taught me a lot.. 
    * I learned some basic sign language just by simply taking the time to look online and trying it out myself.  
    * I also learned to persevere when I couldn't get an image to show up. I got an error and read everything. I instantly found my error and fixed it. 
* My advice to you is to avoid having a fixed mindset. It is nice to have a goal to set a path for you and guide you through the way but sometimes there are certain tweaks that can be made here and there and it might not be how you wanted it in the first place. Just try different things out and do the best you can to start by building a MVP (minimum viable product)! 

* Also, last but not least.. have fun building!
