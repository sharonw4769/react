# Entry 7: Building the App (Cont'd)
### Plans
This week, I will be taking my own pictures for my app. I will be using http://www.lifeprint.com/ as my resource. This way, I can learn some sign language myself while teaching others! 

Currently, I have created two pages, one for **LESSON 1: Numbers** and one for **LESSON 2: ABCs**.

I worked on creating the home page which will consist of the goal of this app and instructions on how to use the app.

### Takeaways
* Building this app taught me a lot.. 
    * I learned some basic sign language just by simply taking the time to look online and trying it out myself.
