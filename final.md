### My Struggles


### Next Steps 


### My Advice & Takeaways 
* Take a look at existing applications because you might find some inspiration here and there. I was originally inspired by [Tom Clarkson](https://github.com/dierat/learn_hanzi)'s app but I also looked at other apps to see what I can add or change. 
* DO NOT be afraid to take advantage of your resources. Use the tools provided.. like Google, because there's a high chance that someone may have the same/similar question or idea as you. 
* Lastly, the best way to learn is to test your code. I know I say this all the time but it's very important to understand what certain parts of code does. The only way to really find out is to go through 'trial and error' and just tinker around. 
* Some motivation for this week...
