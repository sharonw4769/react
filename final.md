### My Struggles
My biggest struggle is finding a source that can teach me how to add a quiz component for the multiple choice quiz page. I found [this JSfiddle link](http://jsfiddle.net/seesyong/dwa1v229/) with an example of the component but I am not sure how to add it into my code. So, as of right now, the way to solve this is to do what I know just so I do not mess up any previous code. Instead of the 'radio' quiz component, I will be lettering the choices instead. 

### Next Steps 
- [ ] Figure how to add the radio component for the QUIZ page
- [ ] Try to incorporate all links into one file
- [ ] Find a way to present my app without requiring the QR scanner (Expo)

### My Advice & Takeaways 
* Take a look at existing applications because you might find some inspiration here and there. I was originally inspired by [Tom Clarkson](https://github.com/dierat/learn_hanzi)'s app but I also looked at other apps to see what I can add or change. 
* DO NOT be afraid to take advantage of your resources. Use the tools provided.. like Google, because there's a high chance that someone may have the same/similar question or idea as you. 
* Lastly, the best way to learn is to test your code. I know I say this all the time but it's very important to understand what certain parts of code does. The only way to really find out is to go through 'trial and error' and just tinker around. 
* Some motivation for this week...
