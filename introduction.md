# Entry 1: Introduction to REACT.js
When I started learning web design, I really enjoyed working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Specifically, JavaScript because it was a challenging topic. So, I decided that I would give it another try and dive deeper into a new JavaScript library in order to take on my own challenge. My goal? To create an application/website that teacher people American Sign Language.
### What is REACT.js? 
* REACT is a JavaScript library used for **U**ser **I**nterfaces (**UI**): the interactions between the user and the computer/software. <br>
* REACT was developed at Facebook and is used by their company as well as at Instagram. In fact, Instagram.com is written ***entirely*** using REACT. 
### What is Virtual DOM and how is different from the HTML DOM? 
* This concept called Virtual DOM (which stands for **D**ocument **O**bject **M**ode) is used together with REACT to show any changes.
* In fact, it is a ***representation*** of a DOM object, meaning the virtual DOM does not have the power to directly make any changes. In other words, when there are any changes made on the DOM in REACT, the virtual DOM will update automaticall and then the changes get updated on the "real" HTML DOM, causing the screen to make those changes.

HTML DOM:

The HTML DOM uses different element [attributes and methods](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp). 
* Virtual DOM manipulation is faster than the HTML DOM (since nothing happens on the screen). 

### What is JSX? 
* JSX (JavaScript XML), is a syntax extension (of JS) / programming language that is used with REACT by adding XML, also known as, e**X**tensible **M**arkup **L**anguage, which deals with storing and managing data.

### What I Learned + Takeaways
After doing lots of research on REACT.js, I have come to conclude:
React uses JSX to describe what the UI looks like and as for the DOM, it is simply a programming model.
1. As I start getting familiar with REACT.js, I am trying to understand the different aspects of it in order to paint a picture/diagram in my head. I would suggest that the best way to fully grasp the details and form a visual idea of what the process is like is to use your resouces and look up any avaliable diagrams for better understanding. 

For example:

2. Also, ~~feel free to~~ TRY out the code and see what happens. Make observations because it can help you understand! 

3. Do not give up! No one knows everything so just try to atleast learn something new everyday.
