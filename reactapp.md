# Entry 5:
For this entry, I wil be planning out possible application ideas that I can create using React.JS/React Native and noting down my plan. 
##### Example of an "APP"
**[Click here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/showcase.html) to see a few apps that are using REACT**

![example](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jKHL1tfIYyZ5lIXvmRwa9g.png)

The "application" above consists of components; in fact, everything above IS a component. 

To break it down further..
- App (the **main** component -- red box)
    - Profile (**child** component - green box)
    - Hobbies (**child** component - blue box)

**Like mentioned previously, data is collected and is usually passed in one direction (parent to child components).

##### My Plans 
Inspired by [Tom Clarkson](https://github.com/TomClarkson/hanzi-gold)'s Hanzi Gold App, I plan on creating a similar application but instead of chinese characters, the user gets to learn the alphabet and numbers in sign language. There will be a provided letter/number with an image of someone showing it in sign language. 

I created a wireframe to show what I want my application to look like:

### What I Learned + Takeaways
* First step to creating an application: 
    *  Like Mr. Mueller always says, "create a minimum viable product (MVP) first." There are no apps out there that is perfect, which is why there are updates and changes made every once in a while.

* My advice: 
    * Always sketch out your application/ using a format/layout/structure that works best for you! This way, you can visually see what you can change and tweak to create the best app.
